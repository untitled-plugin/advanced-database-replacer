If you are not an IT specialist then you should use some extra plugin to create a backup, like WP Database Backup, and then start the replacement process. You can use the condition group to fit your query and limit the data that can be affected by the replacing process.

= What should I do when ADR broke my website? =
In this case, the database backup that you create before replacement will be indispensable. You have to have access to your database (most hosting providers allow access to the database) and then upload a backup database.
